# Raffle Ticket Protocol

## About

The Raffle Ticket Protocol is a smart contract that lists NFT-based lotteries based on parameters preset by the creator. It as an open source tool that allows everyone to create their own lotteries with customizable supplies, ticket images and rewards.
The contract is also connected to the Web3 Bazaar escrow smart contract, enabling a trustless P2P trade for ticket buyers and reward claimers.
